## üßê About <a name = "about"></a>

**LeadHub Service** is the foundational backend system for Real Sources Africa‚Äôs LeadHub platform. It supports multi-tenancy, secure lead management, and administrative oversight.  
Each tenant (e.g., government agency, investment authority) can create, manage, and view only their trade leads, with strict data isolation.  
An admin interface allows for onboarding new tenants and system-wide statistics reporting.


## üèÅ Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```bash
- Go 1.20+
- Docker & Docker Compose
- PostgreSQL 14+
- Redis
- GNU Make (optional, for scripted workflows)
```

### Installing

- Clone the repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Blue-Davinci/leadhub-service.git
cd leadhub-service
```
- Set up environment variables:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

- Apply database migrations:

```bash
go run cmd/migrate.go up
```

## üîß Running the tests <a name = "tests"></a>

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system.

### Break down into end to end tests

Run unit tests

```bash
go test ./...
```
_Integration and e2e test instructions coming soon._

### And coding style tests

_coming soon_

```bash
echo "we coming"
```

## üéà Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Once running locally:
```bash
API base URL: http://localhost:4000/v1

Health check: GET /v1/health

Trade leads: GET /v1/trade_leads/ (Bearer token required)
```

## üöÄ DevOps & Deployment <a name = "deployment"></a>

### Quick Start
```bash
# Development environment
make docker/dev

# Production deployment  
make deploy/production
```

### CI/CD Pipeline
- **Automated Testing**: Unit, integration, and security tests
- **Container Security**: Vulnerability scanning with Trivy
- **Multi-environment**: Staging (development branch) and Production (releases)
- **Health Monitoring**: Automated health checks and rollback

### Documentation
- **[Complete Deployment Guide](./docs/DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Comprehensive deployment procedures
- **[DevOps Guide](./docs/DEVOPS.md)** - Infrastructure and operational procedures  
- **[Implementation Summary](./docs/IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md)** - Technical implementation details

## üß™ Testing <a name = "testing"></a>

```bash
# Run all tests
make test/all

# Test coverage report
./test.sh
```

**Test Coverage:**
- Multi-tenant security validation
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting and panic recovery
- Business logic validation
- Financial precision testing

## üìö API Documentation <a name = "api_docs"></a>

### Authentication

}

# Get API token
POST /v1/api/authentication
{
  "email": "john@company.com",
  "password": "securepassword"
}
```

### Trade Leads Management
```bash
# Create trade lead (authenticated)
POST /v1/trade_leads/
Authorization: Bearer <token>
{
  "title": "Software Development Project",
  "description": "Mobile app development",
  "value": 50000.00
}

# Get tenant's trade leads
GET /v1/trade_leads/
Authorization: Bearer <token>
